    <h4>Description:</h4>
    <p>
      Artisan fries are a type of french fry made with thicker cut potatoes,
      deep fried and tossed in herbs, spices, and other flavorings. They come in
      different shapes and sizes and can be served both hot or cold. Common
      spice combinations include garlic-Parmesan, rosemary-thyme, Cajun, and
      even sweet potato fries. Artisan fries have a more robust texture than
      traditional French fries, with a crunchy outside that gives way to a
      flaky, tender inside. They should also have a strong onion, garlic, or
      herb scent that arouses the senses. When it comes to preparation, Artisan
      fries are usually prepared by coating the cut potatoes with four basic
      ingredients - oil, salt, pepper, and any additional desired herbs, spices,
      or seasonings. <br />Many recipes also recommend pre-boiling these
      seasoned wedges before giving them their final crisp in the oven or deep
      fryer. Overall, If you are looking for something more flavorful than your
      standard french fry experience, Artisan fries are an excellent option for
      a delicious side dish.
